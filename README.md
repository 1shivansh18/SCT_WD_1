Project Title: Responsive Navigation Menu
Description:
As part of the SkillCraft Technology web development internship, I created a responsive navigation menu using only HTML and CSS.

Key features include:

Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

Smooth hover effects using CSS transitions

Scroll-aware navigation styling with CSS

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS
